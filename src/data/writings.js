      "## A short summary of the book \nThe story begins in 1714, France, when a woman named Addie Larue is tricked into making a deal with a dark god, Luc. He grants her immortality, but cursed to be **forgotten by everyone she meets**, thereby making her live an *invisible* life for years to come.",
      "For centuries Addie lives in solitude, with Luc visiting her on their 'anniversaries' to torment her into giving up her soul to him. However, Addie remains steadfast and grows to resent Luc for his constant manipulation. Eventually, Luc becomes the only constant in Addie's world of temporary connections. She finds herself looking forward to his visits, wrestling with feelings that toe between hatred and growing affection. Addie and Luc engage in a short romantic stint, which ends horribly. Luc does not visit her for years to come.",
      "Addie then meets Henry — the ++first person in 300 years who remembers her++. They fall in love, only for Addie to discover the truth: Henry too made a deal with Luc, and his time is running out.",
      "At first, Addie thinks Luc messed up by allowing the two of them to meet, only to find out that they played right into his plans. He wanted Addie to fall in love with Henry — and then be forced to grieve him when he dies in a few weeks. Luc orchestrated this entire plot to show Addie that mortal love is fragile and not worth the pain. He wanted Addie to run back to him.",
      "However, Luc's plan backfires. Addie remains stubborn and is instead all the more determined to make full use of her remaining time with Henry.",
      "On Henry's final night, Addie reveals that she made another deal with Luc to save Henry. The catch is that Addie must go with Luc. Henry is devastated, but Addie tells him she has lived long enough, and it is now Henry's turn to make the most of his. She makes Henry promise to remember her, before vanishing.",
      "> \"'You better live a good life, Henry Strauss' She begins to pull away, but his grip tightens. 'No'. She sighs, 'You've given me so much, Henry. But I need you to do one more thing.' Her forehead presses against his. '**I need you to remember.**'\"",
      "The story ends off with Addie walking by a bookstore, parallelism of where Henry and her first met. She observes a book: \"The invisible life of Addie Larue\" written by Henry. However, inwardly she finds comfort in that she has tricked Luc the same way he tricked her all those years before: she did not tell him that she would be his forever - only up till he **no longer wanted her**, and she will do everything she can to make him stop wanting her. For now, Addie says nothing and only smiles as Luc pulls her into his arms.",
      "That is how the book ends, leaving the ending up for interpretation.",
      "## My thoughts",
      "From this, we can gather that in the end, Addie goes with Luc, and Henry writes a book about her titled 'The Invisible Life of Addie Larue'.",
      "I think it's a brilliant book. The ending may not sit well for others but in my opinion, it is clever and open-ended. I think many readers take for granted the revelation that Henry is the author of the book, and the world of possibilities it opens up.",
      "Because this makes it plausible that Addie's story is not told in total objectivity.",
      "## Henry's ending vs the Truth\nThe final chapter tells Addie's careful wording of her deal with Luc: \n> 'I'll be yours as long as you want me by your side'",
      "along with her supposed plan to make Luc hate her over time. In my opinion, this is merely Henry's interpretation of what had happened. This is his ending. The ending he wishes for.",
      "The realisation that the book is from Henry's perspective makes the reader ponder whether Addie's accounts were objective or if they were coloured with Henry's desires — with what he *wanted* to happen — he *wanted* Addie to be reluctant to go with Luc, that she only went with him in the name of saving Henry. He *wanted* to remember her as noble, as someone who reciprocated his love.",
      "*The truth is, Henry does not know at all*",
      "## Addie and Luc: More than Enemies?\nConsidering that Addie's story is told through Henry's lens, we can gather that Addie told Henry about her erratic relationship with Luc. Their relationship is explored in small fragments, from sensations of attraction, betrayal,  to fascination.",
      "This makes one wonder whether the sparse and short-lived bouts of romantic interest for Luc sprinkled few and far between throughout the book is truly insignificant — or if it is instead just a projection of what Henry *wants* it to be.",
      "Luc is humanised more and more as the story unfolds. He became capable of love for Addie, with his regular visits, and even admits to enjoying her company. Addie, in turn, also wonders about her feelings for Luc.",
      "The book shows Addie trying to convince herself it is not love. Then again, I think this is justified. Given their tumultous connection over 300 years, the line between love and obsession can be easily blurred. However, one can also interpret it as Addie denying it so fiercely because deep down she knows she caught intense feelings for him, feelings that could even be much stronger than those for Henry.",
      "## A Happy Ending in Disguise?\nAddie admits that she is no longer human, and by extension no longer capable of *human* love. After centuries of immortality, her perspective has shifted. Maybe Luc is the only one truly capable of understanding her.",
      "If that is the case, maybe her ending with Luc isn't tragic at all. She gets freedom from loneliness, a partnership with someone who matches her in wit, cunning and immortality. But since the book is told in Henry's point of view, it makes sense to end it off with Addie's vengeance and hatred for Luc.",
      "For Henry, it is tragic. For Addie, it could be liberation, with a hint of danger.",
      "## Why I Love the Ending\nThe ending of the book is thought-provoking and that's what I love about it. Schwab leaves us to piece together our own version of events from the book's tiny cues, our own emotions and interpretations of the characters' motives.",
      "You could take the ending purely as it is from Henry's perspective, reading a story of darkness and self-sacrifice. On the other hand, you can also see it as a story of freedom, manipulation and unexpected companionship.",

She finds herself looking forward to his visits, wrestling with feelings that toe between hatred and growing affection. Addie and Luc engage in a short romantic stint, which ends horribly. Luc does not visit her for years to come.</p>\n<p>Addie then meets Henry — the <u>first person in 300 years who remembers her</u>. They fall in love, only for Addie to discover the truth: Henry too made a deal with Luc, and his time is running out.</p>\n<p>At first, Addie thinks Luc messed up by allowing the two of them to meet, only to find out that they played right into his plans. He wanted Addie to fall in love with Henry — and then be forced to grieve him when he dies in a few weeks. Luc orchestrated this entire plot to show Addie that mortal love is fragile and not worth the pain. He wanted Addie to run back to him.</p>\n<p>However, Luc&#39;s plan backfires. Addie remains stubborn and is instead all the more determined to make full use of her remaining time with Henry.</p>\n<p>On Henry&#39;s final night, Addie reveals that she made another deal with Luc to save Henry. The catch is that Addie must go with Luc. Henry is devastated, but Addie tells him she has lived long enough, and it is now Henry&#39;s turn to make the most of his. She makes Henry promise to remember her, before vanishing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;You better live a good life, Henry Strauss&#39; She begins to pull away, but his grip tightens. &#39;No&#39;. She sighs, &#39;You&#39;ve given me so much, Henry. But I need you to do one more thing.&#39; Her forehead presses against his. &#39;<strong>I need you to remember.</strong>&#39;&quot;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The story ends off with Addie walking by a bookstore, parallelism of where Henry and her first met. She observes a book: &quot;The invisible life of Addie Larue&quot; written by Henry. However, inwardly she finds comfort in that she has tricked Luc the same way he tricked her all those years before: she did not tell him that she would be his forever - only up till he <strong>no longer wanted her</strong>, and she will do everything she can to make him stop wanting her. For now, Addie says nothing and only smiles as Luc pulls her into his arms.</p>\n<p>That is how the book ends, leaving the ending up for interpretation.</p>\n<h2>My thoughts</h2>\n<p>From this, we can gather that in the end, Addie goes with Luc, and Henry writes a book about her titled &#39;The Invisible Life of Addie Larue&#39;.</p>\n<p>I think it&#39;s a brilliant book. The ending may not sit well for others but in my opinion, it is clever and open-ended. I think many readers take for granted the revelation that Henry is the author of the book, and the world of possibilities it opens up.</p>\n<p>Because this makes it plausible that Addie&#39;s story is not told in total objectivity.</p>\n<h2>Henry&#39;s ending vs the Truth</h2>\n<p>The final chapter tells Addie&#39;s careful wording of her deal with Luc:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#39;I&#39;ll be yours as long as you want me by your side&#39;</p></blockquote>\n<p>along with her supposed plan to make Luc hate her over time. In my opinion, this is merely Henry&#39;s interpretation of what had happened. This is his ending. The ending he wishes for.</p>\n<p>The realisation that the book is from Henry&#39;s perspective makes the reader ponder whether Addie&#39;s accounts were objective or if they were coloured with Henry&#39;s desires — with what he <em>wanted</em> to happen — he <em>wanted</em> Addie to be reluctant to go with Luc, that she only went with him in the name of saving Henry. He <em>wanted</em> to remember her as noble, as someone who reciprocated his love.</p>\n<p><em>The truth is, Henry does not know at all</em></p>\n<h2>Addie and Luc: More than Enemies?</h2>\n<p>Considering that Addie&#39;s story is told through Henry&#39;s lens, we can gather that Addie told Henry about her erratic relationship with Luc. Their relationship is explored in small fragments, from sensations of attraction, betrayal,  to fascination.</p>\n<p>This makes one wonder whether the sparse and short-lived bouts of romantic interest for Luc sprinkled few and far between throughout the book is truly insignificant — or if it is instead just a projection of what Henry <em>wants</em> it to be.</p>\n<p>Luc is humanised more and more as the story unfolds. He became capable of love for Addie, with his regular visits, and even admits to enjoying her company. Addie, in turn, also wonders about her feelings for Luc.</p>\n<p>The book shows Addie trying to convince herself it is not love. Then again, I think this is justified. Given their tumultous connection over 300 years, the line between love and obsession can be easily blurred. However, one can also interpret it as Addie denying it so fiercely because deep down she knows she caught intense feelings for him, feelings that could even be much stronger than those for Henry.</p>\n<h2>A Happy Ending in Disguise?</h2>\n<p>Addie admits that she is no longer human, and by extension no longer capable of <em>human</em> love. After centuries of immortality, her perspective has shifted. Maybe Luc is the only one truly capable of understanding her.</p>\n<p>If that is the case, maybe her ending with Luc isn&#39;t tragic at all. She gets freedom from loneliness, a partnership with someone who matches her in wit, cunning and immortality. But since the book is told in Henry&#39;s point of view, it makes sense to end it off with Addie&#39;s vengeance and hatred for Luc.</p>\n<p>For Henry, it is tragic. For Addie, it could be liberation, with a hint of danger.</p>\n<h2>Why I Love the Ending</h2>\n<p>The ending of the book is thought-provoking and that&#39;s what I love about it. Schwab leaves us to piece together our own version of events from the book&#39;s tiny cues, our own emotions and interpretations of the characters&#39; motives.</p>\n<p>You could take the ending purely as it is from Henry&#39;s perspective, reading a story of darkness and self-sacrifice. On the other hand, you can also see it as a story of freedom, manipulation and unexpected companionship.</p>\n<p><em>The ending is an interplay of perspective, emotional ambiguity and loss. But maybe Addie&#39;s story was never about wins or losses. Maybe its about how we choose to remember her — and the truths we tell ourselves to make the ending feel complete.</em></p>"
