>"I-cha!, you know how to play poker mai?" 

My head swivelled to the right. 

*I-cha.* 

P'X, my local friend, always had his own unique way of saying my name, owing to the Thai accent. 

>"Err a little bit. You have the cards?" 

I found myself standing outside the front door of his family home, an area bearing semblance of an outdoor porch. The space was vast, covered by a low roof to shade from Thailand's unforgiving sun. Tables and chairs scattered all around, his family members moving about. We were at his vacation home. His family from all over gathered here in Khao Yai for a reunion, and he kindly invited me along with some other Singaporean friends to their home in Khao Yai. I found myself across the porch to where P'X was standing at a makeshift table. Glancing down, the table was littered with cards and cups, one for each of the aunties seated around the table. They were all looking up at me now. A mixture of curiosity and anticipation on their faces. 

>"Sawadee ka, my name is Ayesha" 

I smiled and greeted them with a slight bow. Respect was a big thing in Thailand, and I always made a point to show respect, especially towards elders.   

>"I-cha! X friend! Welcome. Come sit na!" 

They smiled back and tapped on an empty chair, beckoning me to sit. I found myself playing poker with them well into the night. Despite the langauge barrier, the friendly gamble served well enough as common ground. Laughing and talking over the game, they seemed more than content in the heat of the moment, playing poker on the lopsided table. A rickety set-up that contributed to an even better atmosphere. I looked up to see some people gathered around what seemed to be a grill. They were fanning it the old-school way whilst another set up an electric fan. Similarly, they were also laughing and drinking. It was a simple, refreshing atmosphere to say the least. 

Further down towards the house gates lay an open area, where we later on sit around in a circle, on our camping chairs. We sat there talking about trivial things I don't even rememeber now. But what I do remember, is looking up at the sky to see it littered with stars. I've never seen so many of them packed together so closely before. I remember my gaze staying plastered on the sky as I relished in the moment. My local friends and their family opened their home to me,  treated me as their own. Made sure I was comfortable. I realised that my heart couldn't be fuller, sitting on an old chair that could barely hold my weight, eating skewers, drinking from $1 cans with foreign music in the background. At that point, I too was content in the simplicity of it all.

Khao Yai was one of my most memorable places in Thailand not beacuse it boasted the most beautiful sceneries or had the most extravagant culture. I have laid eyes on more novel attractions, more remarkable waterfalls, grander mountains. Yet, Khao Yai retains a soft spot in my heart, all beacuse of the people I experienced it with. My local friends proudly showed me around. Drove us in questionable vehicles (with my friend managing to fall off whilst we were moving. oops.) Little Thai tidbits of culture and language every now and then. Even their family would jump in to try and teach us too. All with a warm smile on their face. 

*I-cha*. A completely butchered pronounciation of my name, but it didn't bother me at all. In fact, I marvelled at the fact that I was even lucky enugh to be in such a position. A foreign country, foreign friends who have welcomed me into their family. A unique pronounciation —which the rest of his family adopted— that is now a token of kindness. Of hospitality. Of friendship that transcends beyond langauge barriers.

Khop khun kha, P'X and P'Ung.
