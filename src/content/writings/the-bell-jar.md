#### "I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”

― Sylvia Plath, *The Bell Jar*

## My thoughts 
A beautiful piece of literature, for something as saddening as wasting opportunities in the face of indecision. 

> "I can never be all the people I want, and live all the lives I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all of the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited." 

I wholeheartedly agree. I want to do many things. A person of many interests ― each interest consuming me ― just at different points in time. It was something I used to struggle with, seeing it as a flaw. In fact, it may indeed be a flaw, depending on who you ask. I used to think that I should only pursue interests that makes sense, interests that would be useful in the long run... Interests that have a high ROI, if you will. Coding, personal finance, real estate. For a period of time, I solely pursued these interests and brushed off anything else that interested me but 'didn't make sense'. With reference to the poem, I wanted to pursue a fig where I lived a life of high-income skills and businesses.

However, as much as I loved these interests, restricting myself to pursue these and only these eventually took a toll. I no longer saw them as something that I found joy in learning about. 

This is the turning point in which I decided to branch out, and explore other interests. Since then, I have explored a multitude of other interests, from reading, gardening, sketching, volleyball, pickleball, hiking, skiing, philosophy, psychology, volunteering, tutoring and now writing. I pursued a lot of things that do not necessarily relate to each other. I took solace in that I do not have to limit myself to just one purpose, one talent, one hobby. I allowed myself to have a variety of interests, each of them as meaningful at the time I have them. Through these varying interests, I learnt more about myself, that I enjoy creating things, I enjoy the outdoors and adventure. I learnt that I found joy in giving back to society, that I do my best work when I am inspired by this purpose. 

But then comes the question ― I have all these interests, which then, do I pursue? Or more relevant to me being a final year undergrad, which career path do I pursue? Because likewise, I also have a variety of interests within tech. UI/UX, front end development, big data, model development, artificial intelligence. Knowing myself, I will try to learn all these given the time. Problem is, I do not have much time in school left. Much like in the poem, I found myself sitting at the crux of the many paths I can take. Undecided, I prolong my decision and tell myself I will keep exploring each of these paths and make a better informed decision in time. But what if that time doesn't come? What if I take so long to decide I waste my opportunities?

I actually brought this up to my mentors, and I received a few different pieces of advice. 

One told me to pursue the career path I currently have the most interest in. 
He also cautioned me to heed the warning of overspecialisation. He told me to be careful in getting so caught up in a path that I have trouble switching paths if need be. He gave me an analogy of choosing a field, but still treading footsteps around it to dabble in related fields. 

One told me not to get so caught up with career choices. He said career switches are normal and that I do not need to have my entire career plan figured out by the time I graduate. He advised me instead to look at the bigger picture, to ask myself what kind of life I want to live and base my decisions off of there. 

Both of these advices are sound indeed, both stemming from different perspectives and life experiences. 

These advices are both sound indeed, but the stark difference in their nature gave me comfort in that there is no one right singular way to do things. Choosing one path does not mean abandoning the other entirely. I may not know which fig to choose yet, but I trust that when the time comes to make a decision, I will make the most out of what I know and figure it out from there. 

How about you, what decisions have you been delaying?
