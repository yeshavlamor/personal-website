#### "I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”

― Sylvia Plath

## My thoughts 
A beautiful piece of literature, for something as saddening as wasting opportunities in the face of indecision. 

> "I can never be all the people I want, and live all the lives I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all of the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited." 

I am someone who wants to do many things. A person of many interests―with each interest consuming me―just at different points in time. It was something I used to see as a flaw. In fact, it may indeed be a flaw, depending on who you ask. When I was younger I only focused on interests that makes sense, those that would be useful in the long run... Interests that have a high ROI, if you will.

Personal Finance, Real Estate, Coding. 

I tried to absorb as much knowledge as I can on these topics. I solely pursued them and brushed off anything else that interested me but '*didn't make sense*'. However, as much as I loved learning about these, restricting myself to only these interests eventually took a toll. I no longer saw them as something that I found joy in learning about. i gradually saw them as a chore. This is the turning point in which I decided to branch out. Since then, I have explored a multitude of other random interests:

Reading, Gardening, Sketching, Volleyball, Hiking, Skiing, Philosophy, Psychology, Volunteering, Tutoring and now, Writing. 

I pursued a lot of things that do not necessarily relate to each other(I think my younger self would be confused and wonder what went wrong. oops) but I took solace in that I do not have to limit myself to just one purpose, one talent, one hobby. I allowed myself to have a variety of interests, each of them as meaningful at the time I have them. Through these little explorations, I learnt more about myself. I found that I enjoy creating things, I enjoy the outdoors, travelling and adventure. I learnt that I found joy in giving back to society, that I do my best work when I am inspired by this purpose. 

These varied interests spilled into my career as well. Within tech, I found myself drawn to UI/UX, Front End Development, Big Data, Model Development, and Artificial Intelligence. Knowing myself, I will try to learn all these given the time. Problem is, I do not have much time in school left. Much like in the poem, I found myself sitting at the crux of the many paths I can take. Undecided, I prolong my decision and tell myself I will keep exploring each of these paths and make a better informed decision in time. But what if that time doesn't come? What if I take so long to decide I waste my opportunities?

I actually brought this up to my mentors, and I received two very different, yet equally valueable, pieces of advice. 

One encouraged me to pursue the career path I **currently** have the most interest in, while cautioning against overspecialisation. His advice was to commit, but with flexibility. He said that in whichever field I choose, leave room to explore the surrounding fields, so that I can easily pivot if need be. 

One told me not to get so caught up with career choices. He said career switches are normal, that it takes time to explore such a vast field and interests change all the time. 

> "You do not need to have your entire career plan figured out by the time you graduate." 

Instead, he advised me to look at the bigger picture, to ask myself what kind of life I want to live, and how my career would fit into that. 

Two very wildly different pieces of advice, yet both rang true in their own ways. It gave me comfort in that there is no one right singular answer, no one right singular way to do things. Choosing one path does not mean abandoning the other entirely. 

I may not know which fig to choose yet, but I trust that when the time comes to make a decision, I will make the most out of what I know, and figure it out from there on. 

How about you, which figs are you still hesitating to reach out for?
